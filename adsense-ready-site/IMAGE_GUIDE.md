## Best Practices for Image Integration

### 1. Naming Your Image Files

Before uploading an image, rename the file to describe what it shows. This is important for SEO.

*   **Bad:** `IMG_1234.jpg`
*   **Good:** `effective-study-techniques.jpg`

### 2. Compressing Images

Large image files slow down your website, which is bad for user experience and SEO. Always compress your images before uploading them.

*   **Online Tools:** Use websites like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to reduce the file size without sacrificing much quality.
*   **Target Size:** Aim for image file sizes under 150 KB.

### 3. Adding Alt Text

"Alt text" (alternative text) is the text that displays if an image cannot be loaded. It's also crucial for accessibility (screen readers for the visually impaired) and SEO.

*   **How to add it:** When you upload an image to a CMS like WordPress, there will be a field for "Alt Text".
*   **What to write:** Briefly and accurately describe the image.
    *   **Example:** For an image of a person studying at a desk, the alt text could be: `"A student writing in a notebook while studying at a desk with a laptop."`

### 4. Image Dimensions

Use images that are appropriately sized for your content area. Uploading a massive 4000px wide image for a blog post that is only 800px wide will slow down your site.

*   **Featured Image:** A good standard size is **1200 x 628 pixels**.
*   **In-Content Images:** Should not be much wider than your main content area (e.g., **800-1000 pixels wide**).

5.  **Upload:** Upload the compressed image to your website.
